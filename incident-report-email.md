**Subject:** Incident Report: Unauthorized Tor Usage on Device saul-mde

---

**Dear [Managerâ€™s Name],**

On May 12, 2025, a threat hunt identified unauthorized Tor Browser usage by user `svillan` on device `saul-mde`. The user downloaded, installed, and used Tor, establishing connections to known Tor entry nodes and creating a file named `tor-shopping-list.txt`. The device has been isolated via Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Attached are the detailed findings and log screenshots.

Please advise on next steps, including potential escalation to HR.

Regards,
